1. Implement the user Log In func using firebase.
2. Remove the dummy data and insert real data through firebase like user should be able to see all the details.
4. There is no option for user to enter details so make one (If you guys want to implement that).
3. There is an admin page but no path is fixed or created to access that so make one.
4. Create index for every functions and connect with firestore. 
5. Most of the pages need indexing.
6. Be cautious with the index creating.

Suggestions : Claude is the best option for implementing things so use that.
	      For basic errors go to ChatGpt do not use Claude for everything as there is limited tokens you can use.
              Try to figure out what things are causing errors (Best for learning)
              Use YouTube if needed
